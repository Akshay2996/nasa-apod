# Nasa-APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)

A React App that uses the Nasa's [`APOD`](https://api.nasa.gov/) API to get a new picture of the sky everyday. It's a great way to explore React
basics and at the same time get excited to build a Astronomy Photograph/Video App that changes everyday.
<br />
Don't Believe me! See for yourself today and come back later another day.

##### Topics Covered
